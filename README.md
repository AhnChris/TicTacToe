# TicTacToe

TicTacToe is a mobile app built for the Android platform. The app is modeled exactly after the nostalgic Tic-tac-toe game
where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. A winner is found when a player is able to compose three of their
own marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
